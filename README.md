This repository contains the redesigned logo files for Social Coding. Usage guidelines are as follows:

1. Use the appropriate version based on the background the logo will be placed on
    - If the logo will be on a light background, use the logos in the `Light` directory
    - If the logo will be on a dark background, use the logos in the `Dark` directory
2. Use the highest-quality version of the logo that is available
    - Use the `svg` files whenever possible
    - If for whatever reason you cannot use the vector images, `png` versions are available in various sizes
    - If using the `png` files, use the highest-resolution version possible

- If you need the logo in another format, use the provided Figma file to render to whatever format you need
    - The figma file also contains a key for the colors used in the logo variants
